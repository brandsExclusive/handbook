# Security

Changes which touch on Personally Identifiable Information (including emails, full names, or addresses), or customer payments require a particularly
strong attention to security.

* All developers are required to have read the Privacy Policy & Security policy (part of the HR onboarding)
* Service owners should monitor weekly Github Security Alerts for their repositories, with a critical focus on any
customer facing services
* Major changes relating to authentication, PII, or customer payment handling should involve the CSO or Head of
Engineering to ensure that any pen testing is performed when needed
* All PII data should be encrypted at rest if saved in a database or to disk
* **No** production PII should be pulled onto a local developers environment
* **ALL** staff including contractors are required to follow the Luxury Escapes device policy - of particular note all devices on which company work is done must be encrypted-at-rest
