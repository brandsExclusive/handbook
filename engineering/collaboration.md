# Collaboration

## Architecture Changes

An architecture change includes the following:

* new deployment pipeline strategies
* new data flows
* new usage of cloud product

Before making an architectural change a private [gist](https://gist.github.com/)
should be created outlining the proposed change and what the problem being
solved is.

After the initial draft has been generated a link should be posted in the
\#engineering channel for feedback.

## Code Ownership

Each codebase should have a list of maintainers and collaborators on the readme.

Maintainers are responsible the quality, maintenance, deployment and
architecture of the codebase.

Collaborators have sufficient knowledge to review pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Each code change should go through a pull request no matter how small and be
reviewed by a collaborator or maintainer of the codebase. Github repositories are
configured to disallow merging pull requests that lack an approval.

Pull requests should be small and many to allow rapid review by team members.

## Weekly Kickoff

At the start of each week it's encouraged that everyone posts a message in the \#general room with what they intend to achieve for the week. This is so eveyone gets a general overview of what everyone else is doing.
