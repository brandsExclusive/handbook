# LE handbook

This handbook outlines principles we use to help us build a great software engineering culture. But culture isn't "what's written in our handbook". Culture is what really happens, on the ground, day to day. This handbook describes how we should operate in theory. Culture is how we operate in practice.

It is the responsibility of the senior and lead developers of the team to drive great engineering culture. As such, it's their responsibility to know and understand the principles in this handbook, and to push for their adoption by all team members, across all technical systems.
